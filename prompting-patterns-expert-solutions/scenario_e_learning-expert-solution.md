# Expert Solution: Learning Pattern

## Practice exercise solutions

### 1. Threading safety

**Good prompt:**
```
Concept: Thread safety in cache systems

Questions:
1. What happens if multiple threads access my cache simultaneously?
2. Which operations in my cache_system.py are not thread-safe?
3. How do I add proper locking without killing performance?

Examples:
Show me using my cache_system.py code:
- Web server scenario with 100 concurrent requests accessing cache
- Background thread updating cache while main thread reads from it
- Race condition examples where cache gets corrupted
```

### 2. Memory management

**Good prompt:**
```
Concept: Cache memory management and garbage collection

Questions:
1. How do I prevent my cache from using too much RAM?
2. When should I manually trigger cache cleanup vs automatic?
3. What's the relationship between cache size and memory usage?

Examples:
Show me using my cache_system.py:
- Cache storing large objects (images, files) vs small objects (strings, numbers)
- Memory usage patterns with different eviction policies
- How to monitor and alert when cache memory gets too high
```

### 3. Performance monitoring

**Good prompt:**
```
Concept: Measuring cache effectiveness and performance

Questions:
1. What metrics should I track to know if my cache is working well?
2. How do I calculate cache hit ratio and why does it matter?
3. When should I increase cache size vs change eviction policy?

Examples:
Show me using my cache_system.py:
- Dashboard showing cache hit/miss rates over time
- Comparing performance with cache enabled vs disabled
- A/B testing different cache configurations
```

## Key takeaways

- **Concept**: Be specific about what you want to learn.
- **Questions**: Ask targeted questions, not "explain everything".
- **Examples**: Request examples using your actual code and real scenarios.
- Focus on practical understanding, not just theory.
