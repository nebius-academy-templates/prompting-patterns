# Check Your Work: Compare with Expert Solutions

After completing the prompting scenarios, take some time to review the expert solutions provided in this folder.

## How to Use the Expert Solutions

- Open the corresponding `scenario_*_expert-solution.md` file for the scenario you worked on.
- Read through the expert’s approach and compare it with your own solution.

## Reflect and Assess

Your responses do not have to match the expert’s exactly — there are often multiple valid ways to solve a problem. The expert solutions are here as a reference and learning tool.

As you review, consider the following:

- **What’s different?**  
  How does your solution differ from the expert’s? Did you approach the problem in a unique way?
- **Would you add or change anything?**  
  Are there roles, instructions, or edge cases you would handle differently? Is there something you think the expert missed, or something you could improve?
- **What did you learn?**  
  Did the expert’s solution give you new ideas or highlight areas for growth?

## Be Critical and Curious

Don’t just accept the expert solution as “the only right way.” Think critically:

- Would you add a role or clarify instructions?
- Are there edge cases or user needs that could be addressed better?
- Is the expert’s approach clear and effective for the intended audience?

**Remember:**  
Expert solutions are a guide, not a rulebook. Use them to deepen your understanding and develop your own best practices.
