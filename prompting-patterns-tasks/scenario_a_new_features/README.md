# Scenario A: New Features Pattern

## Step 1: Test the Current Calculator

First, let's see what you're working with:

```bash
python calculator.py
```

**Try these commands:**
- `add` - Add two numbers (e.g., 5 + 3)
- `subtract` - Subtract two numbers  
- `multiply` - Multiply two numbers
- `divide` - Divide two numbers
- `history` - Show your calculation history
- `clear` - Clear the history
- `quit` - Exit the calculator

**What it currently does:** Basic arithmetic with history tracking.

## Step 2: The New Features Formula
**Context + Requirements + File Structure**

### Example Prompt
```
Here's my current calculator code:
[paste calculator.py]

I need to add these features:
1. Square root function
2. Power/exponent function  
3. Clear button to reset display

Please modify:
- calculator.py: Add the new calculation methods
- Update the GUI to include the new buttons
```

### Why This Pattern Works
- **Context**: Shows current code state
- **Requirements**: Numbered list of what to add
- **File Structure**: Which files need changes

## Step 3: Your Turn to Practice

Write prompts using the formula for these scenarios:

1. **Add memory functions** (store, recall, clear memory)
2. **Add percentage calculations** 
3. **Add history feature** (show last 5 calculations)
